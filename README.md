# Facebook Friends Extractor

This little project was just about to extract my friends list to import them in an android software called [Social Contact Photo Sync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michaelflisar.socialcontactphotosync "Social Contact Photo Sync") with Import CSV data functionality.

As it expect a CSV format the JS script export a file like this :

```
James Bond;0074567891
Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath;055117678912345
```

## How to
Go to your facebook profile and click on your friends tab, **scroll down until you friends list is completely loaded**.

- Chrome : Run script with [Snippets Of Code functionality](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/snippets "Snippets Of Code functionality").
- Firefox : Run script with [Scratchpad tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Scratchpad "Scratchpad tool").

And voila!
